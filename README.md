# Rummy

This application allows 2-6 players to play a (modified) game of Rummy. The main difference between this game and the original Rummy is how the scoring works. In this game, players try to get the lowest score possible, with players gaining points by having cards left in their hand when somebody else runs out of cards. The person who ran out of cards will have a score of 0.

## Running the Game

To run the game, run "rummy.py" using your Python interpreter.

## Necessary Packages

This game should not require any extra packages, but some Linux users may need to install tkinter.
